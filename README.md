## Installation

You can install _Peloptimize_ via [pip]:

```console
$ pip install peloptimize
```

That command installs the package in your local Python environment.
However, during development you might want to consider installing it in **
development mode**.

You can do so by adding the `-e` option the installation command:

```console
$ pip install -e .
```

> You can learn more about the differences between `pip install`
> and `pip install -e`
> commands
> at: [pip documentation - development-mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode
> . html#development-mode)

### Python Environment

When installing the _Peloptimize_, it might be a good idea to install
it in a specific Python environment. By default, _Peloptimize_
doesn't restrict the usage of any Python environment
managers ([conda](https://www.anaconda.com/),
[venv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
, [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), etc.).

For more on how to **create**, **activate**, or **manage** environments, please
refer to:

- [conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)
- [virtualenv cheat sheet](https://cheatography.com/ilyes64/cheat-sheets/python-virtual-environments/)
- [poetry cheat sheet](https://vikasz.hashnode.dev/python-poetry-cheatsheet)

> **Edit:** each environment manager has its own ups and downs. I won't start
> the endless
> discussion on which environment manager is the best here. At the end, it depends
> on your
> personal preferences. **Having said that, I strongly recommend choosing one and
sticking with it.**
> Refer to your teammates to define which tool will be the project's default
> environment manager.

## Usage

Please see the [Command-line Reference] for details.

**Edit:** you don't need to be exhaustive, when writing the usage section.
Add links to other documents that explain in-depth the various usages of
_Peloptimize_. Consider adding small videos in the form of
`gifs` too. They're a great way to visually explain the usage of the package,
and show new users how to use it.
