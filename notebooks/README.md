Notebooks
=========

Add to this folder all jupyter notebook files. These include examples, tests,
or tutorials on how to use some feature of your package.

Folder Contents
---------------

> Include a brief overview of the notebooks in this folder.
> This helps others on finding the notebook with the specific information
> that thet are looking for. A lot of times people develop code with the same
> functionality simply because they weren't aware someone already did that.
> Exposing your code is as important as developing it.

Naming convention
-----------------

Use a name convention for the notebooks.
When defining your strategy, you should assess your use-case, and
what makes sense in the project's context. For tutorials and examples,
you might use names that describe the purpose of the notebook.
When using Jupyter as a tool for experimenting and initial development,
you might want to add names that start with your name, followed by
a description of the its purpose. If there's no consise descriptive name
another solution might be to use the datetime of its creation instead of the
description.

Involve all members when creating the naming convention.
Making unilateral choices here will lead to its unadoption.
This is a topic of a lot of debate and no right or wrong answers.
